Gen. Ahmad Ramadhan told reporters.\n\n\"Investigators took legal action \\[…\\] and he is detained in the criminal investigation agency's detention facility for 20 days,\" he said, as quoted by AFP.\n\nDelivered straight to your inbox three times weekly, this curated briefing provides a concise overview of the day's most important issues, covering a wide range of topics from politics to culture and society.\n\nBy registering, you agree with _The Jakarta Post_'s [Privacy Policy](https://www.thejakartapost.com/privacy)\n\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\n\nPanji faces five years in prison for blasphemy, six for spreading hate speech and 10 on the charge of spreading fake news and intentionally causing chaos in public, according to the charges.\n\nFounded in 1996 and home to roughly 5,000 students, the boarding school has caused a stir with practices like allowing men and women to pray alongside each other, and women to become preachers, which are uncommon in Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim-majority nation.\n\nThe country does not follow Islamic law and has a tradition of pluralism and moderate Islam, although more conservative interpretations of the religion have gained ground since the fall of authoritarian leader Soeharto in 1998.\n\nThe school sparked uproar in conservative circles and protests outside its compound when social media footage in late April showed women praying in the same row as men. Women are typically expected to pray behind men in traditional Islamic prayer.\n\nAnother practice of the school that sparked controversy was allowing women to give a sermon in Friday prayers, a task usually reserved for men in traditional Islamic teaching.\n\nThe school is also accused of ties to Darul Islam, a group that fought for an Islamic state in Indonesia in the 1950s and 1960s and survived a military defeat.\n\nThousands have gathered outside the school several times since late June to call for its closure.\n\nThe blasphemy law has been on the statute books since 1965 but was rarely used before the end of Soeharto's rule.\n\nHuman rights activists have condemned the law, saying that it curbs free speech and puts religious freedom under increased pressure.\n\nAndreas Harsono of Human Rights Watch said the Al-Zaytun case was the latest example of discrimination against minority views.\n\n\"If a Muslim cleric is accused of committing blasphemy against Islam for promoting women's rights, something must be terribly wrong with both Indonesia's blasphemy law and the mainstream \\[clerical\\] groups,\" he said as quoted by Reuters.\n\nIndonesia recognizes six official religions but the growing use of the blasphemy law is fueling fears that its moderate brand of Islam was coming under threat from increasingly influential radicals.\n\nBasuki “Ahok” Tjahaja Purnama, a former Jakarta governor who is Christian and of Chinese descent, was sentenced in 2017 to two years in jail for blasphemy.\n\nAuthorities did not specify what Panji had said or done that constituted blasphemy. But they said they were acting on a complaint filed by a group called the Forum of Advocates for Pancasila.\n\nPancasila is the country’s state ideology, which espouses belief in one god, humanity, unity, democracy and justice.\n\nThe group’s leader, Ihsan Tanjung, said he had submitted 15 videos as evidence, including clips of Panji allegedly saying that the Quran comprised sunnah_,_ the words and deeds of Muhammad, a prophet of Islam. \n\n“That is very insulting and constitutes deviant teaching,” Ihsan told BenarNews. “It is very disturbing and can cause hostility.” \n\nAccording to Islamic belief, the Quran is God’s speech revealed to the Prophet Muhammad.\n\nIhsan said other offending videos included one that allegedly showed Panji teaching his students to sing a Jewish song _“Hevenu Shalom Aleichem”_, and another showing him leading a prayer with men and women in the same row, which is against Islamic norms.\n\n“All the videos we handed over to the police can create unrest and hatred,” Ihsan said.\n\nPanji has denied the accusations.\n\nHe had earlier told the Liputan6 news website that the mixed-gender prayer was a way to give women equal rights. \n\n“Women deserve equal rights. So, we make them equal, because it’s the right thing to do,” he was quoted as saying.\n\nDefense lawyer Hendra Effendi said he would seek a stay of his client’s detention and file a pretrial motion to challenge his arrest. He said Panji should be released on humanitarian grounds.\n\n“He is too old at 77,” Hendra said, adding his client also has health issues.\n\nHendra denied that Panji had committed blasphemy or taught anything that deviated from Islam.\n\n“His teachings are only based on the Quran and the sunnah,” which are the practices of Muhammad, he said.",
